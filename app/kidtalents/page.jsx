        Developing your kids talents
      </h1>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Every child is born with unique abilities and interests. Some children
        naturally excel in music, others in drawing, sports, storytelling,
        problem-solving, or leadership. These natural abilities are called
        talents. Talents are like seedsâ€”if nurtured and developed, they can grow
        into something amazing!

        ways children can develop their talents
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Children discover their talents through exploration and practice. By
        trying different activities such as painting, singing, playing an
        instrument, or solving puzzles, they can find what they enjoy and what
        they are naturally good at. Parents and teachers play a key role in
        helping children identify and develop their talents by providing
        encouragement and opportunities to learn.
